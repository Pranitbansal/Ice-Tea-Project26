Steeping the Tea:-
 1. In a pan pour the water that we took (1.25 litres).
 2. Heat the pan on a medium flame and let the water come to a boil. 
 3. Once the water comes to a boil, switch off the flame and add 2 tablespoons black tea powder. 
 4. Add sugar.  Mix very well. 
 5. Let the tea leaves steep in the water for 4 to 5 minutes. For a lighter tea flavor, you can steep for 2 to 3 minutes. 
 6. After the tea is steeped in the hot water, then add 3 tablespoons lemon juice. For a more lemony taste, you can add 4 tablespoons lemon juice also. 
 7. Stir with a spoon. 
 8. Then strain the lemon tea in a steel or glass jar. The glass jar should be able to handle the heat. 
 9. Let the lemon tea cool at room temperature. Later you can chill it in the fridge. 

Making Iced Tea:-
 1. While serving, add 4 to 5 ice cubes in a glass. You can add less or more as per your preference. 
 2. Also add 1 to 2 lemon slices. Adding lemon slices is optional.
 3. Pour the lemon tea in the glass.
 4. Garnish with a lemon slice or a sprig of mint leaves. 
 5. Serve iced tea immediately. While drinking do stir lemon iced tea with a stirrer or a spoon.
